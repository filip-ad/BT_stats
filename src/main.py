        # Scrape and update club data
        #
        #  It seems that player licenses and transitions are only available for clubs that are currently active. 
        #  If a club is no longer active, it won't have any player licenses or transitions listed, not even historical ones.
        #  However, player rankings are available for all clubs, even those that are no longer active.
        #
        #  This means we need to:
        #
        #   1. Scrape active clubs from the license lists.
        #   2. Scrape inactive clubs from the player ranking lists.
        #
        # But it should be enought with 2. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

        #### Backup this table as a create statement because it won't be updated often
