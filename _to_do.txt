To do
=======================================================
 - Gör om tournament_class
 Istället för att spara alla länkar, borde jag väl spara class_id_ext och konstruera URL:er m h a den?
 https://resultat.ondata.se/ViewClassPDF.php?classID=18599&stage=1
 - Script to itentify possible player aliases, based on licenses?
 - Batch inserts for upd_player_license - and check if relevant 
   for scraping functions (raw)
    

Improvements long term
=======================================================
- Fix player transitions and add new licenses... will probably only work for "active" clubs but will help when matching old match data
- Runtime in logs and prints?
- Fix the pathing/packages whatever so everything doesnt have to be in /src
- Figure out how to deal with transitions, 
  Im thinking to create a separate player_license table which can be searched if not "real" license is found
  This would keep the integrity of the player_license so it only holds real scraped data
