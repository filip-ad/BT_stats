# clubs_data
Add clubs_data_add 

# Saturday Dec 1:
- Data quality checks. Ask Claude Opus to 

- Review full codebase and understand the intentions, 
- Full log to see results
- Access and query the db with read only mode
- Then analyze:
  - Where are the major data quality issues
  - Do we have any low hanging fruit to fix quickly?
  - Any bugs in the ETL flow? Inconsistencies or logical errors?
  - Any bugs in the code/scripts?
  - Any functionality we are not using?
  - What can be streamlined? Used as common utils?
  - Ideas for more clever ways of running the flow, while keeping it modular and customizable with filters/variables?
  - Reporting, like the excel output as is. Review where we can utilize OperationLogger and logger_keys better?
  - Are we missing any obvious functionality? 
  - Do we clean up properly, orphan records etc? 
  - Do we have a flow where new data of better quality always replaces old? Like replacing an unverified player in touraments and matches with verified if we had update player license data?
  - I want to deploy to the website fairly soon (with prepared db for player profiles etc), what should we prioritize before doing that? Wanna get to at least 95%+ correct data.
  

To do
=======================================================
- Fixa en AGENTS.md för Codex i ./codex (?) som beskriver venv miljön och db:n så att den kan köra kommandon i sin sandbox
- Fixa ett script som laddar ner alla PDF:er senaste månaden, sedan ta bort force download i scrapers/resolvers
- Fixa RO64 PDF match parser...
- Fixa run log så att runs appendar och inte tar bort gamla rader?
- Ordna upp filer, så att alla loggar hamnar på samma ställe, clubs_data etc ligger i proper folder names... ta bort skit som inte används
- Fixa lika snygg debug output som i KO match scrapern för de andra scripten...


Improvements long term
=======================================================
- Run the Codex code review from Github
- When scheduling, implement a logfunction that writes the task (eg scrape_tournaments_ondata) and the results (updated/inserted/failed) - in single file that can be read in the morning
- How to "upgrade" player to verified? With a separate script?
  - Create a script for identifying non verified players that now have a license...?    
- Fix the pathing/packages whatever so everything doesnt have to be in /src
- Figure out how to deal with transitions - currently raw transitions are not used 
  - Should be able to search the transtion RAW tables for players not found. Then I can resolve firstname and lastname, even though I dont have player_id_ext!
- Add DEBUG = True/False INSIDE key methods, and IF DEBUG statements, to debug certain parts of the code...!
