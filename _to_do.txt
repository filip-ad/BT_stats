To do
=======================================================

 - Split validation and insert function with only "clean" records. Implement batch insert.
   This way db_results will always be OK, but create new validation_results to print.
 - Refine _find_player_dupl.py, and start cleaning data by mapping duplicates
 - Simplify cache functions by creating a generic build_cache(cursor, table_name, key_fields, value_fields="*" function)
    

Improvements long term
=======================================================
- Fix the pathing/packages whatever so everything doesnt have to be in /src
- Figure out how to deal with transitions
  Im thinking to create a separate player_license table which can be searched if not "real" license is found
  This would keep the integrity of the player_license so it only holds real scraped data
