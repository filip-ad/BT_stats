To do
=======================================================

Download all PDF:s?

- Create a script for identifying non verified players that now have a license...?

 - Simplify cache functions by creating a generic build_cache(cursor, table_name, key_fields, value_fields="*" function)
    

Improvements long term
=======================================================
- Fix the pathing/packages whatever so everything doesnt have to be in /src
- Figure out how to deal with transitions
  Im thinking to create a separate player_license table which can be searched if not "real" license is found
  This would keep the integrity of the player_license so it only holds real scraped data
- Should be able to search the transtion and license RAW tables for players not found. Then I can resolve firstname and lastname, even though I dont have player_id_ext!
