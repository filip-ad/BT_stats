To do
=======================================================

Download all PDF:s?

Make sure all classes are robust and well documented, to protect the database. 
Minimize all db calls, handle it with verifications in the classes. 
Add UPSERT:s instead of dropping tables... and use upsert/save to db always!

Must start identifying doubles and divisions early, just sort them out initilially, then we fix proper parsing later.

Manual work on player and club duplciates..


 - Split validation and insert function with only "clean" records. Implement batch insert.
   This way db_results will always be OK, but create new validation_results to print.

 - Simplify cache functions by creating a generic build_cache(cursor, table_name, key_fields, value_fields="*" function)
    

Improvements long term
=======================================================
- Fix the pathing/packages whatever so everything doesnt have to be in /src
- Figure out how to deal with transitions
  Im thinking to create a separate player_license table which can be searched if not "real" license is found
  This would keep the integrity of the player_license so it only holds real scraped data
- Should be able to search the transtion and license RAW tables for players not found. Then I can resolve firstname and lastname, even though I dont have player_id_ext!
