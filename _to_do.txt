To do
=======================================================
- Fixa RO64 PDF match parser...



Improvements long term
=======================================================
- When scheduling, implement a logfunction that writes the task (eg scrape_tournaments_ondata) and the results (updated/inserted/failed) - in single file that can be read in the morning
- How to "upgrade" player to verified? With a separate script?
  - Create a script for identifying non verified players that now have a license...?    
- Fix the pathing/packages whatever so everything doesnt have to be in /src
- Figure out how to deal with transitions - currently raw transitions are not used 
  - Should be able to search the transtion RAW tables for players not found. Then I can resolve firstname and lastname, even though I dont have player_id_ext!
- Add DEBUG = True/False INSIDE key methods, and IF DEBUG statements, to debug certain parts of the code...!
